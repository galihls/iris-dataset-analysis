### **Repository Name: iris-knn-classifier**

### **Description:**
This repository contains a simple machine learning project focused on classifying species of the Iris flower using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The Iris dataset, which is a well-known dataset for beginners in machine learning, is used to demonstrate basic data processing, model building, and evaluation techniques.

### **Project Overview:**
- **Dataset:** Iris flower dataset from the `scikit-learn` library.
- **Algorithm:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification.
- **Libraries used:** 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
  - `scikit-learn` for model building and evaluation.
  - `matplotlib` for data visualization.
- **Goal:** To classify the species of Iris flowers based on features like sepal and petal dimensions.

### **Steps included:**
1. Loading the Iris dataset.
2. Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
3. Splitting the dataset into training and test sets.
4. Building and training the KNN model.
5. Evaluating the model using accuracy metrics.
6. Visualizing the dataset.

### **How to use:**
Clone this repository and run the Jupyter notebook or open it in Google Colab to see the steps and results.
